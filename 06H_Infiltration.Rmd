Compare the infiltration for ‚Äúsand‚Äù or ‚Äúbare soil‚Äù for the SCS Curve Number method and the Green-Ampt equations. Consider 5 in. precipitation. Start with the average parameters for sand:
ùúÇ = 0.437
ùúÉi = 0.05 (assumption)
Bd = 1550 kg/m3
ùúì = 4.95 cm
K = 11.78 cm/h
CN (II) = 77
Differences you may observe highlight the need for calibration of models. You may wish to use a spreadsheet for the iterative calculations.





A soil sample taken from the field with a 10 cmlong by 5 cm diameter cylindrical tube has a fieldweight of 306 g and an oven-dried weight of 245g. For the soil sample, calculate the: a) bulkdensity and porosity and b) volumetric soilmoisture and relative saturation.


Suppose the volumetric soil moisture at a particular site ismeasured to be 0.024. Immediately after the soil moisturemeasurement is taken, the region experiences a snowmeltevent lasting 12 hours with a uniform melt flux intensity of0.69 mm/hr. Assume that this region is uniformly covered bysandy loam soil. Similar to a rainfall event, a snowmelt eventcan result in infiltration and/or infiltration excess runoff. Inthe case of a snowmelt event, the melt flux/rate would beanalogous to the rainfall rate during a storm event.  Assume the soil instead corresponded to one with thefollowing soil hydraulic properties: saturated hydraulicconductivity of 0.00125 cm hr-1, saturated matric head of -21.8cm, porosity of 0.435, and Brooks-Corey parameter b of 4.9. Isit possible that infiltration excess runoff will occur in thewatershed given the same snowmelt event described above?Justify your response. Using Green-Amptmodels, compute the time to ponding under these conditions.Will ponding occur for these conditions? Explain yourreasoning
