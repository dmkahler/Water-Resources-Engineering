1. Indicate which of the following statements are correct.  An unstable atmosphere:
- a. Causes turbulence to be damped;
- b. Usually results in vertical profile of horizontal wind velocity that is more uniform than the stable atmosphere;
- c. Causes the mean horizontal wind velocity to be larger (on a regional scale) than that of a neutral atmosphere;
- d. In the surface layer is favorable to disperse the pollutants;
- e. Is likely to be found over a deep lake in the spring, when warm air blows over the water.

2. Indicate which of the following statements are correct.  Stable conditions in the atmosphere near the Earthâ€™s surface:
- a. Result in increased turbulent mixing (compared to unstable conditions);
- b. Are necessarily the result of smoothness of the surface;
- c. Are often observed under nearly windless conditions with the surface cooling by longwave radiation;
- d. Would be expected over an extensive and deep water body in early spring under a cloudy sky, when warm air moves over the water;
- e. Are more likely to be accompanied by dew (negative evaporation) than unstable conditions (over land);
- f. Indicate that there is a high likelihood for thunderstorm activity.

3. Given the data for a summer day in a temperate climate, air temperature $T_a = 17.94\ ^{\circ} C$, relative humidity $66%$, incoming short-wave radiation $R_s = 226.79\ W\ m^{-2}$.  Calculate net radiation in $W\ m^{-2}$ for a surface covered with active, short vegetation (assume an albedo of $\alpha = 0.2$ and surface emissivity of $\varepsilon_s = 0.97$).  Assume the air temperature is equal to the surface temperature.  Recall,

\begin{equation}
R_{lu} = \varepsilon_s \sigma T_s^4  
\end{equation}  

\begin{equation}
R_{ld} = \varepsilon_a \sigma T_a^4  
\end{equation}  

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_a = a\ (\frac{e_a}{T_a})^b  
\end{equation}  
where the constants were found empirically, $a = 1.24$ and $b = 1/7$, $e_a$ is the vapor pressure in hPa (equivalent to mb), and $T$ is in Kelvin.  

4. How much liquid water in a month (in $mm\ month^{-1}$) can be evaporated by an energy supply of $1\ W\ m^{-2}$?  Assume $25 ^{\circ}C$.

5. Given the following measurements:
- $R_n = 250\ W\ m^{-2}$
- $G = 30\ W\ m^{-2}$
- $H = 55\ W\ m^{-2}$  

Calculate:  
- a. What is the evaporation rate in $mm\ day^{-1}$?  
- b. What is the Bowen ratio?  
- c. Was the atmosphere stable, neutral, or unstable?
