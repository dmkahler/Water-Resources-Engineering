## Overview  
This example, numbered *5a*, includes three elements:
1. Return Period  
2. Rating Curve Computation  
3. Watershed analysis  

The example uses the Little Pine Creek watershed in Pittsburgh, PA.  USGS gage [03049800](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/03049800/) was used for the historic data and rating curve.  The data from this 

## Return Period  
The return period is based on the data from Little Pine Creek, which is included in this repository subdirectory: 05a_discharge.csv.  Adjust 05a_discharge.R to perform the return period calculations.  

## Rating Curve  
The rating curve is calculated based on a subset of the historic data.  The following codes should be run in order:  
1. 05a_rating_curve.R - this outputs 05a_sept2024.csv, an input for the next code  
2. 05a_rating_curve.ipynb - the installations are noted in the notebook  
3. 05a_compare.R - this will compare the result from the previous code with the USGS rating curve, also in this subdirectory

## Watershed Delineation  
Watershed delineation is done with geographical information systems (GIS).  [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) is an open-source GIS application for Windows, MacOS, and others.  The steps to delineate the watershed are explained a [video](https://youtu.be/F94SdRL80Rs).  

Note: the SAGA processing toolbox is no longer available through the QGIS core setup.  There are a few options to install SAGA: install a previous version of QGIS (e.g., 3.28), or install the plugin at installation.  Please see the instructor for assistance.
